## 1D Pressure Drop Prediction Tool
The single-phase and two-phase thermo-hydraulic evaluation of refrigerant pipes in an automotive vapor compression cycle is important while designing the system. 
The modeling of single-phase and two-phase flow in commercial 3D solvers is not only computationally expensive but many solver cannot capture the flow dynamics properly. 
To design efficient systems, the accurate prediction of pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of pipes is necessary. 
The present study aims to develop a customized tool using open-source resources for characterization of pipes in real-time.

The customized tool is developed as two different modules. 
The function of module – 1 is to extract geometrical features of pipes and segregate them segment-wise. 
The function of module – 2 is to use the geometrical details of pipe and evaluate the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of the pipe. 
The aim is to complete this evaluation within a few seconds so that the process time in designing these pipes will reduce drastically.
