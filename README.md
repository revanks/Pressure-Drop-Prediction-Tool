### About the tool

Pressure characterization tool is a customized tool for real-time prediction of pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of pipes. The tool has in-built automation with user friendly interface and is able to predict results within few seconds. 



The tool has three evaluation mode 
- 	Standard evaluation
- 	Specific evaluation
- 	Tee junction/split evaluation.

- In ‘Standard evaluation’ tab, common refrigerant pipes are evaluated with no need of specifying any boundary conditions. The tool is able to identify the pipe through its ‘standard’ name and evaluate it using pre-defined boundary conditions. The user has to enter very minimal
information to start the evaluation.

- In ‘Specific evaluation’ tab, refrigerant pipes that needs to be evaluated at specific/different boundary condition compared to standard boundary conditions can be analyzed. Up to 10 different pipes can be simultaneously evaluated at different flow states like, Subcooled, Superheated or Mixture. This tab is specifically developed for comparing new pipe geometry at different boundary conditions.

- In ‘Tee junction/split evaluation’ tab, junctions/splits with 90o branch angle can be analyzed. Unlike in the previous tabs, the user has to define the geometry of the Tee manually to start the evaluation.
